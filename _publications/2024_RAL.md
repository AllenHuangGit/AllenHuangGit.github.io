collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024_RAL
excerpt: 'Introduced a novel foam-embedded soft robotic joint design (Fe-Joint) and the new continuum soft robotic arm (Fe-Arm). Proposed an iterative self-improving learning strategy (ISL) with the LSTM architecture for end-to-end inverse kinematic modeling of the Fe-Arm.'
