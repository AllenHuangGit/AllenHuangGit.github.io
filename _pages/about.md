Hi! My name is **Anlun Huang** (黄安伦). You can also call me **Allen**.

I am a second-year Master’s student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the **UC San Diego**, majoring in **Intelligent Systems, Robotics & Control**. Currently, I am a member of the **[Advanced Robotics and Controls Laboratory (ARClab)](https://ucsdarclab.com/)**, advised by **[Prof. Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/)**, working on **Robot Learning** and **Motion Planning**.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Robotics Engineering from the **[Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)**, where I worked with **[Prof. Sicong Liu](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/liusicong.html)** and **[Prof. Zheng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2NSTu2EAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)** on **Soft Robotics**.


## **Research Interests**
I am passionate about **Embodied AI and Robot Learning**, focusing on:
- **Robot Learning**: Reinforcement learning and imitation learning for humanoid robots loco-manipulation tasks.
- **Motion Planning**: Neural network-based motion planning for robot manipulators, gradient-based optimization.
- **Soft Robotics**: Learning-based modeling and control of continuum robots.

I'm eager to apply my skills to **real-world robotic systems** to enhance **adaptability**, **efficiency**, and **robustness**.

## **Recent News**
- **[2025/02]**: I am looking for internship and full-time opportunities in Robotics, starting from Summer 2025. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any openings!
