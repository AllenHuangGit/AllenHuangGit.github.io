title: "Deformable Soft-rigid Hybrid Tank Robot Driven by Origami Twisting Soft Pneumatic Actuators"
collection: projects
excerpt: 'Designed the SR-Tank, a revolutionary soft robot utilizing origami twisting soft pneumatic actuators (OT-SPAs) in conjunction with bellows, enabling multidirectional movement on complex terrains and adjustable width. Formulated the kinematic model for OT-SPAs. Developed the pneumatic control and vision system of the robot, facilitating motor-like mobility for the SR-Tank.'
